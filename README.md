* Web and Python part: Collection of data pulled from the mitocheck screen (http://www.mitocheck.org/) and uniprot. The idea was to find genes which are the most involved into migration and nuclear shape phenotype. Data was extracted from the SQL base dump of the whole mitocheck project, API extracted images relevant to each phenotype and UniProt descriptions pulled from their API

* PhD part: scripts that belong to my PhD dissertation
